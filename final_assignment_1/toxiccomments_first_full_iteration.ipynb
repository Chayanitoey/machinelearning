To illustrate my point, let’s take the State of Oaxaca. We will need a link to the state in every single municipality (Oaxaca has 570!), in every single river that passes by, in every single lake, lagoon, dam, forest, desert, valley, plateau, mountain, cave, indigenous group, highway, bridge, volcano, beach, port, island...

If someone says that José Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca but links to the state instead of the city, s/he is still OK, not as precise as s/he intended to be, but s/he’s still correct. But if someone says that the cave of Guilá Naquitz is in Oaxaca and points to the city instead of the State, s/he is plain wrong.\n",

      "Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)\"\n",

Most of these articles were started using the surname only, as per custom in the Shakespearean community, but several editors, unfamiliar with the topic and who almost exclusively edit with bots, misguidedly changed them.\n",

If I were defending an extremist like a Ku Klux Klan member, then I would understand you pointing out that I ain't in the Klan.  But sheriffs aren't extremists.

If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?\n",

Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie.

The claim \"\"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States\"\" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read.

Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.\n",

Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British.

He wrote his beliefs into the edicts of ashoka, which reflect his buddhist identity. He patronized buddhism. Since he was buddhist by heart, there was nothing to mention about him regarding hinduism apart of the contemporary compiled Sanskrit literature of oral tradition.

      "\n",
      "I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term \"\"disproportionableness\"\". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other \"\"ism\"\". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say \"\"floccinaucinihilipilification\"\", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.\n",

      "1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I have changed the repeated phrasing \"\"Most auxiliaries\"\" / \"\"Most modals\"\" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.\n",

      "1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you \"\"admins\"\" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as \"\"personal attacks\"\" or \"\"harassment\"\" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of \"\"ebaY\"\" logo to go next to the current one, \"\"ebay,\"\" in the lead, is \"\"because I wanted it in there,\"\" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly \"\"not okay\"\" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him and \"\"smiley girl\"\" there to falsely accuse my edits of being \"\"vandalism\"\" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a \"\"personal attack\"\" just because I'm an IP-only editor?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with \"\"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',\"\" or \"\"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' \"\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that \"\" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense\"\"? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called \"\"consensus\"\" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called \"\"consensus\"\" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) \"\"consensus\"\" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive \"\"consensus,\"\" do the same thing, it's \"\"edit-warring\"\" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the \"\"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense\"\" rule)?\n",

      " It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.\n",
      " Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat. \n",

      " EESWARA CHEKAVA EZHAVAR  ( Summons everybody regarding tackling with Nair Vandals and also about SURNAMES of \"\"Ezhavar\"\" ) \n",
      "\n",
      "Dear \"\"Ezhava\"\" friends, I am a 6th Dan Black Belt in Shoto-Khan ( Karate ) and also having 2 Degrees in both Kalarippayattu (Vadakkan Style) and Shawolin Kung-fu ( Wing Chun Style ).. hailing from an Orthodox Chekava Ezhavar family in north Malabar, and also a Master in Law (M.L.M) and have been practicing in High Court . Our family is one of the reputed Chekava families in Kerala and trainers of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" for centuries. And according to our family sayings our family was the leading \"\"Kalari\"\"(the temple for training \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\")  in kerala for training \"\"Vadakkan Style\"\" & \"\"Thekkan Style\"\". And hear that when Nairs and all came to Kerala, they were very poor and good in character and were the servants of \"\"Namboothiri-Brahmin-Caste\"\" .One thing we are very proud with to tell that, even centuries before the arrival of \"\"Brahmins\"\" & \"\"Nairs\"\" to kerala, here our ancestors had made this martial art of \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" well disciplined one and practiced with all of its systematized weaponry methods. At that time, we used the word \"\"Kalari\"\" to mean the \"\"training place\"\" from which word the name \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" was derived. After nairs had come here, \"\"Nairs\"\" also started to study \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\" from our kalari traditions under strict disciplines. Like the same...\"\"Muslims\"\" and \"\"Chritians\"\" also started mastering in \"\"the kalarippayattu\"\" from \"\"Chekava Ezhavar\"\" families.You can see so many \"\"Christian & Muslim\"\" kalari experts also in the history. It doesn't mean that the \"\"kalarippayattu\"\" was brought from Arabia. The \"\"Nairs\"\" also came here some centuries back. But it had been a cultural martial orthodox tradition that was related to the blood of Malabar region as a part of its hereditary Chekava Society. But the shameless \"\"Nair Society\"\" after coming here and after studying the tricks and techniques from the people inhibited here ..now would like to teach the world that they are the main practitioners of this martial art even when this martial art has been practiced here for thousands of years by the other people in this region. If so \"\"Muslims&Christians;\"\" also can start claiming that it was brought here from Arabia.    But when the \"\"Brahmins (Namboothiris) started getting donations ( \"\" Dhanam\"\") like lands, golds, and so many things in other kind..from the rulers from our castes in ancient times  , \"\"Brahmins\"\" became landlords. \"\"Nairs\"\" also became \"\"Rich\"\" gradually when the nairs started a cheap system called \"\"Sambandham\"\"(a system of giving Nair Women to any rich traveller people in their way like \"\"Namboothiri\"\" for using that woman for a short period of time comparing to marriage,  to obtain and to posses the lands,houses and their other assets held by those traveler / Namboodhiris. I saw in the wikipedia website that, this system was stopped by social reformers playing humiliating public Dramas in front of them with the help also of Gentle Nair Men.Because it was a system like which we cant see ever in the history or ever in the world even in the people inhabiting in jungles ).In the modern world, it is not called as \"\"sambandham\"\" but we use some other words to denote these types of cultures. The same shameless system what they used to obtain \"\"Brahmin's\"\" assets, now they use to obtain the reputation regarding \"\"Kalarippayattu\"\". What the ancestors of the \"\"Nairs\"\" did \n",
      "was not a problem of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". It was just the problem of their ancestors. We don't want to feel guilty conscious in their cultural tragedy. We don't want to discuss about their past, but what makes us this much angry is their intolerance in others traditional supremacy and brutal nature to destroy our public records because of jealousy. Should we attack \"\"Nair\"\" websites in return of it?..\"\"NO\"\". We don't want to attack others. But what we want to do is we want to grow ourselves and we want to let others also to grow. This is our tradition. We don't want to attack others and we don't want to posses other's assets/cultures. And in one another point of view we can be proud also. Because even though these castes trying to include us under their  Varna System we should know that we are just above of all of these systems and , when the \"\"Brahmins\"\" came to this place, our ancestors could  give them enough Land and Accommodations and Houses considering they are \"\"Brahmins\"\". That is why the \"\"Brahmins\"\" use the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" for their houses.Because, actually the word \"\"ILLAM\"\" meant for the houses of \"\"Ezhavar\"\". Still the historical word \"\"ILLAM\"\" is used for \"\"Ezhava Houses\"\". As the \"\" Nairs\"\" were the workers of \"\"Namboothiris\"\" they also received some shares from the donations through \"\"Namboothiris\"\" and also by \"\"Sambandham\"\".

Who says most pop culture references educate or mock and depict it as inferior? Your own observations? Then it's also original research. It's also strongly non-neutral-point-of-view. ∇∆∇∆ \"\n",

IF A PERSON ACTUALLY READ WIKIPEDIA or any other scholarly source they would not sound as ignorant.  HOWEVER, I will conclude that the two individuals in this case, Tenebrae and Bbb23 that have been conducting character assassinations on a users homepage, while blocking out an individual from using THEIR OWN ACCOUNT thoroughly displays the gestapo tactics involved, and that it was intended to mean Anti-JEWISH as many others that are not aware of the meaning of the words they use have done and continue to do (HENCE THE DEFINITION OF IGNORANCE). More to the point, however, is that I am not anti-anything, it ALL serves a purpose. Furthermore, calling someone Jewish that is Jewish is not an insult.  I am not certain that calling someone Jewish that is NOT Jewish is an insult either, but if YOU consider it to be such than perhaps you should be examining YOUR OWN CONDITION.  To continue on, claiming that I, or anyone else have ascertained information simply from reading one's chosen handle reveals just how blocked your consciousness is.  How is it that I know this person is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews  and you do not?  I AM WELL AWARE OF WHO YOU ARE, TENEBRAE, and that you DO KNOW SCARLETT JOHANSSON, like most of us, AS SHE IS A VERY PUBLIC FIGURE and that YOU are SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO HER.  I am sure you will lie and say that is not true, but just as there is no shame in being Jewish, there is no shame in finding Johanssen attractive.\n",

Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  Sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.\n",

With regard to \"\"Shuttegod\"\" I am in militant disagreement that the previous text he mangled & reduced in his arrogant edit was \"\"wordy\"\" or \"\"awkward\"\", it was a tight, concise very well written opening to the article explaining in essence what the Anglosphere is. What he reduced it to with his edit - with its bombastic egotistical patronising editing note - was weakly written, mushy, vague & illogical at points. Sorry if that's a bit tuff, but it's the truth. The Anglosphere is an increasingly important concept geo-strategically & it's important to get this source for the term right for those who search via Google for an explanation of it. I am open to edits, but they need to augment & improve the opening text, not reduce & state things that are not true, such as \"\"Eire being a part of the Anglosphere\"\" - any1 with the slightest comprehension of the history of Ireland since 1916 can see the fallacy of this view, & whomever holds it does not grasp even the basics of what the Anglosphere actually is!\n",

One would have to make a serious jump to non-local hidden variable theories in order to have ANY hidden variable theory. Am I right in saying that there's no evidence or theoretical proof that says information can move faster than the speed of light? How could one even consider hidden variable theories without making that jump to assume information can move faster than the speed of light? Even if the speed of light is beatable, how would we prove it? The bias in the physics section is leaning towards is determinism because it says hidden variable theories could happen, it doesn't mention Bell's theorem, AND it makes a terrible counter-argument to hidden variable theories using that number genorator nonsense. As Gibbzmann said, this seems to put hidden variable deterministic theories on par with indeterministic theories by having Bell's theorem absent. Determinism and hidden variable theories may make people happy, but Bell's theorem says otherwise on the topic of local hidden variable theories.

      "That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so \"\"on the index\"\" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.\n",

      "Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered \"\"Catholic\"\", so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term \"\"hardcore.\"\"  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.  However, the question of the Rosary sort of gets to the heart of the matter.   00:22, 11\"\n",

      "When indicating \"\"passing\"\" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)What do you mean by \"\"passing\"\". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries \"\"enforce\"\" these requirements?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these \"\"passing\"\" grades?  Your \"\"grades\"\" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Most importantly, since the term \"\"required\"\" calls for a resource by which adherence to this \"\"requirement\"\" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through \"\"blind trust\"\") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip \"\"grades\"\" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  \n",
      " \n",
      "Example: \n",
      "\n",
      "NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org\"\"\n",
      "      AND\n",
      "ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  \"\"\n",
      "      AND\n",
      "TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.\n",
      " \n",
      "4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.\n",

      " As for \"\"some\"\", consensus is achieved through use of \"\"some\"\" as it cannot be argued against, and reflects known facts, while leaving room for unknown facts and contrary positions. Leaving it out pushes a POV. That is not consensus. Consensus is where everyone agrees, not where one side bullies or browbeats another into silence. To find consensus construct a sentence that we call all agree on. Adding \"\"some\"\" goes a long way towards that end.  \"\n",

It's definately not a question of favouritism or anything else, it's just a work in progress. Unfortunately Slayers isn't a priority for my editing, so it's very much stop/start at this end.

      "Hello, Drmargi. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me, but in a very respectful, sophisticated manner. I've taken the time to review both articles you referenced, especially personal attacks. While what I said was not directed at any specific person, it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack. For that, I'd like to apologize. The reason I verbally came out swinging, so to speak, is because of misdirected frustration. There is an individual with whom I had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show, a show about which I'm almost as passionate as I am about Person of Interest, and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit (mind you, for good reason I now know), however, when this took place on another TV show's page, he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities. I had just started using Wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol, or even writing code (that is not the case anymore) Please do not misinterpret this, as I know I am the one in the wrong, and I am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which I somehow look like the victim. I just feel as though I needed to explain myself, and who better with whom to do so than the one of 4 users on Wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am well aware that the world will not end if the POI Season 5 info is not complete (lol). If I thought the world were to end, I wouldn't be on my computer. But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren't. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia's rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I've offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I'm glad I've learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I'm not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won't happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.\n",

      "Let's leave that to one side however, we could always come back to it later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of my point, leaving aside the bias issue, is three-fold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, irrespective of your argument that this is presented as a claim, the fact remains that the way the claim is presented is illogical - there is no fair comparator for the claim that \"\"Nuclear Power is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions\"\". A fair comparator should be found or some idea of efficiency viz. inefficiency should be presented, if even from the biased source itself, before re-inserting this part. Without it, it is on the same level as saying something as intellectually vacant as \"\"some people claim that Ferraris are not fast machines\"\". Not exactly the sort of style an Encyclopaedia should be aiming for, especially on a scientific article, would you not agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, with respect to your argument, the very empirical information the underlying source uses is being mistreated in what amounts to, if I may say, a misuse of data on a level which is so obvious it it would actually be quite comical if it were where it belonged along with many thousands of other equally lazy special interest group papers. It is  a self-contradicting source. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes its supposition that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions by producing a table of data. The data shows \"\"Yearly Costs to Avoid 1000kg of CO2 Emissions\"\". These are divided between Energy Conservation Measures and Energy Production Methods. Nuclear Power is shown to be more efficient than solar power and as efficient as wind power at cutting emissions. However, the only conclusion the article draws is that Nuclear Power is inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions. By your logic, I could equally claim in this article using the same source that \"\"some environmental groups claim Wind and Solar Power are inefficient at cutting CO2 emissions\"\". You can see how this would get a little crazy, no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, there is only one quoted source yet the text reads \"\"but environmental organizations indicate the problems with nuclear waste and claim that this energy is neither efficient nor effective in cutting CO2 emissions, excluding it from clean energy\"\". Why is it pluralised? Surely the text should read something along the lines of \"\"the WISE group, a Dutch anti-nuclear lobby group indicate the problems...\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I can see the point you are trying to raise here is based on one guideline - as a claim, it is not presented as fact. That would be fine for articles dealing with philosophical issues, or political issues or any other number of normative debates. But we are not discussing ethics here. We are discussing the efficiency of Nuclear Power in cutting CO2 Emissions. We have to hold Scientific articles to a higher level of proof when it comes to \"\"making claims\"\" or worse, \"\"stating beliefs\"\". Science, prima facie, is about the pursuit of absolute truth, not the espousal of circumscribed belief. That way leads to the abuse of Science.\n",

      "Surname: Podd\n",
      "This very unusual name is of English medieval origins, of which it has two, both quite separate. The first is a variant of the surname Pott. This is either a shortened form of the medieval given name Philpott, from the popular name Phillip, meaning \"\"lover of horses\"\", or is residential or locational, and describes a person who lived by a depression in the ground, or who came from a place such as Potcote in the county of Northamptonshire, or Potsgrove in Bedfordshire. The change in spelling from \"\"tt\"\" to \"\"dd\"\" is a common one and due to regional and dialectual differences as well as careless spelling. Another possible explanation is that it is a variant of Poad, a surname which means 'toad', and was a nickname surname for a person who was thought in someway to represent this animal. The church records of the Southwold Independent church in Suffolk records the baptism of James Pott in 1741 and of Elizabeth Podd in 1757. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Richard Pode. This was dated 1230, in the Pipe Rolls of Devonshire, during the reign of King Henry IIIrd of England, 1216 - 1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \"\"develop\"\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.\"\n",

I often go to Atalaya Castle and Brookgreen Gardens - but basically for the enjoyment and taking pictures. I know little of the history of these places, other than what is in the brochures given out by the state. All the pictures at Brookgreen Gardens is mine - including at the bottom a slide show presentation of additional pictures. All the pictures at Commons are also mine. All the pictures at Atalaya Castle are also mine, except for the B & W one. Also recently I added a slide show presentation at the bottom of the group of pictures of additional pictures I took in 2006. Do these slide show presentations work for you? I have checked them on various computers at various locations and they appear to work properly (especially of the high speed connections). Sorry I couldn't help more. I think probably your best bet is others that edit these articles, especially the ones that started them (if they are still around). There is an article on Huntington Beach State Park which I have edited, however basically from a formating \"\"clean up\"\" standpoint (removing peacock terms). Notice they are requesting additional photos of HBSP, so will have to go take some and enter into the article. Maybe even make a slide show. What do you think of this idea of a \"\"slide show\"\" of pictures? Should they be narrated or is classical music alright? How about amateur home movies of places like this? BTY, Atalya Castle is directly across Highway 17 from Brookgreen Gardens. Brookgreen Gardens is about a mile directly inland. In the slide show of Atalaya the first slide shows the original road going directly from the residence of Atalaya Castle to Brookgreen Gardens as the Huntingtons would have used it in the 1930's to move the large sculptures. Since, Highway 17 was built and has cut it in half. All this property was then owned by the Huntingtons.  talk \"\n",

      "Sorry for not replying, MH - I did not see anything further I could say there that would advance towards a solution. My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments. I think I disagree with both Ikip and Ludwigs2 more often than I agree, but they in particular have made good comments.\n",

Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct. There have already been a number of RS/N, NPOV/N, and BLP/N discussions of related issues that could probably be exhumed for background.

      "Kristof the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.\n",

A perfect example is streaming live video. But as a developer I can't see how these principals apply to what we're trying to achieve with the RADIUS protocol. Surely the overhead of TCP wouldn't have any scalability or performance issues on fast networks and modern hardware? Someone please enlighten me why they chose UDP for RADIUS.  \n",

      " Why UDP?  Answer \n",
      "\n",
      "RADIUS is designed to scale to large-scale deployments with dozens, maybe hundreds of BASs all talking occasionally to a couple of central servers. Given the underlying reliability of modern networks, the overhead of maintaining hundreds of open TCP connections would have been overkill. The alternative (open a connection each time a packet needs to be sent) would also have been inefficient (no point in performing a 3-way handshake for the sake of a single accounting update). On balance, UDP is probably the best choice.\n",

      "Remember that RADIUS has built-in acknowledgement/retransmission mechanisms to cope with the occasional lost packet.\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",

      "Another reason is that when RADIUS was designed, it was possible to implement a UDP stack in a single embedded chip, but a TCP stack was more complicated (read: more expensive). This seems rather silly now, but it was a real problem designing cheap devices back then.\n",

IA32e is not a mode of Yamhill processor, but the superset or extension of IA-32e, in other words, when ia32e enabled 32bits and 64bits codes could work seamlessly, because ia32e scale up the original IA-32 by extending the width of registers and execution units, extended segment descriptors and paging mechanism would also introduced with it. IA32e does not make a processor turn into a real 64 bit processor, but just make a 32 bit processor has the capability to do the 64 bit computing from the ground. The benefits of this is that we don't have a second 64bit-lised IA-32, what we need is an architecture completely designed for 64 bit computing from scratch, for example Itanium or something else.

So segmentation had been accompanied with x86 processor since its beginning. Without protection mechanism introduced, segmenataion is the only way to address all possible and potential physical space. Because Segmentation is found in the real mode, so addresses in Segmentation tends to be real, with solid link the physcial address rather than virtual address when in protected mode when paging is enabled. So if it is a real x86 processor, its maximum physical addressing space should be limited by its segmentation mechanism rather than paging.\"\n",

In my style, Shotokan, the philosophy is to take out an opponent with one blow (ippon) so as to be ready for any others, but we still train in grappling and escapes quite a lot.

Poland was not the first county invaded by Hitler. The warfare started when Britain and France had sold Czechoslovakia to Hitler (read up on Munich Agreements, preferably not in wikipedia ;) ) with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. To deal with the shameful fact, the historians had just polished it out of the WW2 history. And now British public believes that the WW2 started at 1 Sep 1939. Hop!

      "Well thank you for finally having the courtesy to participate in the discussion. In response. 1)Yes, I agree that there is a perception of overlap between ALSF, the yl's and so forth. This perception however is an inaccurate one. One only need do factiva searches on the hostility between alsf and the yl's in the 1980's and 1990's for instance. Indeed in some states liberal students and young liberals have nothign to do with each other still. In contrast to the YL's, the ALSF is not considered part of the Liberal Party, and the party has no authority over it. If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this clearer on the ALSF page, I shall be more than happy to take this on board. 2)Stating that the YL's and Liberal Students in NSW have worked together and held joint functions does nothing to counteract what i just said. I fail to see the relevance. Furthermore, we're talking about joint functions between the NSW Liberal Students Association and the YL's, not alsf. 3)Most importantly, what on earth does this have to do with the issue at hand, regarding Macquarie Uni? I really can't see it. Again I ask, is there ANYTHING in the media, or anywhere other than with two Wiki editors that links the actions of Victor to ALSF?

It is speculative why he did this although I again agree with pm_shef when he made the assumption it was to draw funds out of his municipal campaign fund, which seems like a reasonable reason to me.  I don’t know what the laws are on putting your name in for nomination while holding other office.  But this now seems to be a common practice here in Vaughan for example, Alan Shefman put his name in to run municipally in 2004 by-election (Councillor) while still holding another municipally elected position (school trustee), Susan Kadis did a similar thing in 2004 as well, running federally while still holding municipal office and Racco also did it in 2003 when he ran provincially while still holding municipal office.  I do have to say this practice may be legal but I see it as unethical.

This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: \"\"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who \"\"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth\"\" but this was dismissed as \"\"speculative opinion\"\" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  \"\n",

You just throw out everything that does not fit to your personal view. Try to edit articles more for the reader and not for yourself. What is wrong if one sentence is not quite adequate and explicit. On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please.

I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what μ(n) means and shows. Simply as that.\n",

      " Pro-Gay Bias? \n",
      "To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a \"\"pro-gay bias\"\"? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be \"\"pro-gay\"\" would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a \"\"pro-gay bias\"\" is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a \"\"post-industrial\"\" cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly \"\"increased\"\"  as a result of the  \"\"modern urbanity of the post-industrial age\"\", when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century. On these grounds, I intend to revert this article.  10:00, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

No harm done, as I was offline of WP briefly at the time myself  and I learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to WP Notability standards, a lesson I've applied elsewhere.  I also learned more about the WP distinction between Primary and Secondary sources.  The result is all to the good. I'll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing, though I think on first sight that the template's terse wording  \"\"This article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past\"\"   could be clearer as to its intent: does this really suffice to, in your words, \"\"let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason\"\"?  I hope so, though it was not obvious to me: it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue.  If you can see it that way, as a relatively novice editor might, perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect, with some procedural directives and relevant links, to the original PROD and the policy guidelines for continuance.

My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go, because Marbella is too turistic, and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the \"\"people\"\" or mass tourism. Another reason are the great golf courses that are near. P.S.:You said in your comment \"\"we are just a little bit richer\"\", it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was \"\"normal\"\" to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a \"\"big\"\" orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a \"\"neutral\"\" Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   \"\n",

However, RE: your removal of \"\"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context\"\": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (\"\"Draft\"\" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a \"\"live\"\" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.

      "It appears that Cailil is the only person taking issue with a comments and criticisms section. It is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. I think Cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. This here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. Admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. More often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their NON-neutral point of view. Wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the Policies are generally adhered to, even Jimmy Wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies. The comments and criticisms section needs to be put back into this article, I would do it myself but I cannot find it in the history section. If someone finds it but is afraid to replace it due to Cailil's threats link it to me in my user talk page.

      "Designed and constructed in the mid-century modern style of the period, the Green Fairway Estates tract is perched on the edge of Tahquitz Golf Course in the southern part of the city. The fairway homes begin near the corner of Lakeside Drive and Brentwood and snake their way down the street continuing on to a portion of Pebble Beach. Each home was built according one of nine master floor plans, each theme being repeated only two or three times due to the limited number of homes that were constructed prior to 1965  the year that the Alexanders died in a plane crash. Fortunately for the development, however, a number of Green Fairway Estates were completed prior to or soon after this terrible accident.\n",

      "The Green Fairway Estates are in many ways the \"\"Brigadoon\"\" Alexanders of Palm Springs, as very few people  even die-hard modernists  know about the neighborhood. Many of the Green Fairway homes are executed in an Asiatic or South Pacific style, influenced no doubt by the sense of Eastern exoticism being brought home by World War II soldiers. Construction features include A-frame roofs, lava rock facades, Aztec motifs, and other \"\"exotic\"\" features. With floorplan names like The Royal Singapore and The Maracaibo, the whimsical ideals and themes of the period are in full force. \n",

      "The architect responsible for these models was architect Donald Wexler  architect of the Palm Springs International Airport and the now famous North End steel homes. The area surrounding the tract was originally surveyed and developed by the Westview Development Company in 1958. Westview Development Corporation was operated by Chicago residential and commercial developer Morton Zuckerman (president) and vice-president Frank Bogert, mayor of Palm Springs. In charge of sales was realtor and developer George Gannon. The designer of the golf course was Lawrence Huges.\"\n",

      "He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. \n",
      "Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: \n",
      "“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”\n",
      "The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.\n",
      "A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”\n",
      "The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.\n",
      "“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”\n",
      "Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”\n",
      "The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.\n",
      "Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”\n",
      "But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”\n",

If you say that CH denial/support is a matter of faith, then it's like saying that the entire Global Warming article should be tagged as POV/faith subject as well, not just the denial article. You realize of course that this is not something feasible. Although I personally doubt man-made global warming, the subject has nothing to do with faith. It's about facts, data, and interpreting/analyzing/understanding the data (so long as the data is not false or misleading). There are scientists who oppose the mainstream opinion, and there are scientists who go along with the mainstream opinion in order to keep their jobs/position.

Is WP a general encyclopedia that includes philatelic material, or a union of general and specialized encyclopedias? Secondly, is it a worthwhile effort to fight for a special exception to WP's usual practices? I would say not, because industry usage seems like more of a longstanding convention rather than a key point of fact (I've never seen an \"\"official\"\" explanation of the GB preference, for instance), and redirects work well enough to get people to our content (there should be category redirects irrespective of the name chosen). Deletion review or categories for discussion would be the right places to reopen, but based on past experience, \"\"everybody in philately uses GB\"\" alone is not going to be compelling enough to get an overturn.  \"\n",

Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   \n",

In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.\n",
      "Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945.

Then we also appear more moral historically.\"\"\n",

Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.\"\"\n",

So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the \"\"control\"\" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent.

I remember her from Y&R; back in the early 80s. She was some slut who was portrayed by some Donnelley girl. I totally can't picture Maura as Diane. Eeew! Anyway if you're fearing the future for GH then I won't start watching again. I wanted to get back into it this year but if it's still crummy storylines then screw it lol. BTW is Leslie Charleston still on GH?? Didn't she portray like someone named Monica or something?? Yeah I hate The Talk. It was such a poor replacement for ATWT, if they wanted to cancel it then the actors can just come to my house and perform the soap for me on the spot!!! lol.

      "Hi.  The original \"\"Land Of Confusion\"\" song/video were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it.  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbed's cover version distorted readers' analysis of the original song/video. (For what it's worth, I personally don't even care for Genesis at all, nor do I have any special fondness for this song/ video, though the video's puppetry was fairly innovative in its day.)  But I & others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans, and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process.  The article is much more fairly balanced now, and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbed's version.  So I have no regrets about how I edited it, nor do I have a problem with what you added back, since I think you added back a judicious amount... though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit. (I only made that one edit to the article & had forgotten all about it until just now.) As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan. 16th, \"\"Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively.\"\"  So you see, the word count (showing clear bias in favor of Disturbed's version over the original version) is what motivated my pruning.  I do welcome your further thoughts on this, though, since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video, & they are a bit more highbrow than most \"\"nu-metal\"\" bands of today. And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most, since theirs did very well on the charts (though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article).  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbed's version. I would be in favor of that; this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially.\n",

This romantic thing is a phenomenon of the 1990s or an influence of the new romantic movement and has nothing to do with the traditional gothic subculture. The same with Gothic architecture, Gothic novels etc. The name of the Gothic subculture came from the Gothic music, a dark, punky music genre, related to death rock and horrorpunk. There was no relation to the Gothic architecture, but a preference for dead and old buildings in ruins, cemetaries, symbols of decay, etc. It was a \"\"death romanticism\"\". The term \"\"gothic\"\" means \"\"dark, gloomy, spooky\"\". I agree, that there are new developments. But now you have a culture without any relation to the roots.

      "Jack-A-Roe, thank you for responding.  That article says, \"\"Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation.\"\"  That raises a question:  In writing the article, I paraphrased the Material (well, some of it).  It seems to me that paraphrasing is necessary when conveying information  I mean, Seth/Roberts published 20 books; and when they discussed a topic, it was discussed in depth.  So my question is:  Is paraphrasing considered to be \"\"interpretation\"\"?  To me it is not interpretation, but others might say it is.\n",

      "It would seem that Verbal thinks I am interpreting instead of paraphrasing.  But since he isn't a knowledgeable editor  meaning an editor with knowledge of the subject matter  I don't see how he can know that.  Verbal, acting on the assumption that I have been interpreting instead of paraphrasing, has been trying to block any new primary sources that I might add.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the article also says that primary sources must be used \"\"with care\"\", but it doesn't say that they can't be used in abundance.  In a case like this, I don't see why the sections that describe the Material can't be abundantly sourced to the Seth books.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do have a handicap when it comes to finding secondary sources (what I've been calling \"\"third-party\"\" sources up to now).  I have always been interested in the Seth material, not metaphysics in general.  Thus, I have almost all the Seth books, but few other books on metaphysical subjects where references to Seth/Roberts might occur.  (I do have many Cayce and Casteneda books, but they don't say a thing about Seth.)  Finding more secondary sources is difficult for me because my town has a small library and (you'll be amazed by this) I don't have a car to drive to the nearest city.  However, it seems to me that, given the sale of 8 million books and the secondary references that are already in the article, notability has already been established.\n",

At the war's end, Israel had seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.\n",

On 4 November 1966, Syria signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt. Nine days later, Israel attacked the city of as-Samu in the Jordanian occupied West Bank in response to raids from the fedayeen group Fatah. King Hussein of Jordan criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt for failing to come to Jordan's aid and \"\"hiding behind UNEF skirts\"\" [I checked Oren p. 135 and there's no mention of this on that page; please help double check source and find reference - possible later printing is different, I have 2003 first edition].\n",

Israel rejected a proposal to restation UNEF on its side of the border. Egyptian forces replaced UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Between 18 and 20 May Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered as a cassus belli, or justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on 22-23 May. On 1 June, Israel formed a National Unity Government by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war.

Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under \"\"other free\"\".[3]}}   \n",

      "TABIn this proposal, I will discuss why the Wikipedia definition for “Probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. Probability is something that is used every day. It is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. However, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. According to Wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and I propose to change this.\n",
      "\n",
      "User:Nparibello-NJITWILL/Summer 2012 | Probability\n",
      "\n",
      "TABThe given Wikipedia definition is as follows: Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] The proposition of interest is usually of the form \"\"Will a specific event occur?\"\" The attitude of mind is of the form \"\"How certain are we that the event will occur?\"\" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. Thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. It begins with, “Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” The word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. Aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. Although I am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, I still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. I would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. The “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. Probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event. \n",
      "TABThe given Wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. It states that, “The proposition of interest is usually of the form…” This is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. The word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. The definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. But what does that really mean? Because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear.\n",
      "TABThe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. For anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. The way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). These ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. I believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. The range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. While this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, I would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. For example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. If the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. As stated in the original definition, “The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”\n",

Both Sheaffer and Shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including NJIT. Both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. From a mathematical standpoint, Richard Sheaffer states that “Probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number P(A) to every event A so that the following axioms hold: P(A) >= 0, and P(S) = 1.” Glenn Shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les\n",

The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  \n",
      "  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.

On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.\"\"  Why do you think that the IDF spokesman's statements from over a week later were so influential, as opposed to these many public statements by Palestinian spokesmen which were widely disseminated in major news outlets?

However that realtionship is much concrete when we speak of the astronomical body otherwise known as Urmomsanus. Plus you have a tiny little piece of wallaby DNA in your genome right now. Apparantly, according to an inside source (God, duh) one day back in 600,000,000,000,000,00 BC one of our ancestors mated with a wallaby and now all humans have this one wallaby gene which allows us to benefit from the new, pound shedding weightloss supplement. If you our any member of your family needs to loose weight just use the wallaby gene idiot. Problem solved. No more questions in life, just relaxation and collecting the money as it comes puring in. So if you are ready to do this then I am too. Its nice to be able to count on you like this, and i feel we are just starting to get to know one another.\n",

It is taking more time than I would have hoped  so I am taking a 5 minute break on doing this to tell you I am working on it.  Simmons does not write classic \"\"hard science\"\" science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein.  Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others.  I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera. Well, yes that \"\"justice\"\" was too fast and I am correctng it! By the way it is customary to add messages at the _bottom_ of somebody's talk page, and not at the top like you did.

      "\"::::::Noren, your argument is ridiculous. Only a very few atoms (helium, neon, and argon) have TRULY filled electron shells, and can participate in energy-releasing fusion.  The reference is making generic statements, so that it specifies \"\"light nuclei\"\" instead of particular elements.  It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.  It DOES specifically state, \"\"In normal conditions between atoms or molecules, the nuclei never get close enough for fusion to commence\"\".  And all of us here know that the conditions of CF are far more normal than stellar.  Regarding the other stuff in my last post, I do know that it is OR and was not trying to get it into the article at this time (it won't be OR forever).  I just wanted to point out to Art, who brags about his Phd, that he's the one who is dead wrong about electron shells being in the way.  I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion.  It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion.  It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here.  IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems?  Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?  The SUN does not fly apart, all its temperature-freed nuclei receding to infinite distance under the influence of mutual electric repulsion (which would indeed happen if there were no electrons in the mix).  He even wants us to believe that while we can mathematically add 2+2 to get 4 in a Wikipedia article, we can't do simple obvious logic that is mathematically equivalent.  If a source article says, \"\"termites caused the collapse of this house\"\", Wikipedia can't be precisely accurate and say, \"\"gravity caused the collapse of that house, after termites weakened its structure\"\"??    \n",

I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.\n",

      "Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \"\"puppet state\"\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \"\n",

I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve \"\"theory\"\" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to \"\"the former Phlogiston theory\"\" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. \n",
      "For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. Cheers,    \"\n",

Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.

I feel I am still suffereing from that as I get regularly visited by one of the same bully team, who hacks up my user page until I complain and then I get banned for WP:BLP or WP:3RR because they coud detect I was thinking about reverting one more time. Another good one is \"\"lack of collaboration\"\" on my own user talk page.  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis. This seems to be the usual psychology, on the Internet in forums and real life, unfortunately. People fear the newbie and the unknown, attacking to rid themselves the unknown.  Most of the protection mechanisms are not available to IP editrs and are unknown. The more I educate myself on the ways of WP the more I realize they ren't not applied to IPs equally. I have been ridiculed so many times here I have toignore most of it, now. /rant off LOL 99.251.114.120  \n",

Saying Aussie Rules is an Australian variety of football does not say that it is more Australian than \"\"gridiron\"\" (NFL is the competition, not the game!) is American. It doesn't say that Australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their \"\"ancestry\"\" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin. Saying some of them are Australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are  \"\"unAustralian\"\" any more than calling Gaelic football an Irish variety implies that Irish soccer players are not Irish/Gaelic!   \"\n",

      " Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a \"\"final process\"\" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's \"\"use it to tip people on social media\"\" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.   \"\n",

      "You're wasting your time, HillBilly. Eric's got form for this sort of thing - if he gets it into his head you're a wrong'un, no amount of evidence or explanations as to how you've never acted against him, had any crossed words with him, or how you actually even like him, will make any difference to him. Although possibly aggravated by his well renowned poor memory for the names of other editors he interacts with, as you saw when you corrected him about his claim you always start ANI threads, he just ignored you and instead upped the ante, referring to your \"\"obvious campaign of harassment\"\" of him. A clear personal attack if ever there was one. He's done it with this 'reformed' account many times already, he did it when he was socking on his 'roommate' account, and he did it when he was just plain old Malleus the b/tard. It's ironic this behaviour is the same sort of bullying he often accused admins of doing. And with no hint of irony at all from him, he accused you of trying to demean and patronise him, even though that's basically how he treats anyone on Wikipedia he doesn't agree with. Still, as you see, nobody cared, due to the fact he gets special protection from the likes of Drmies. Now, let's all have a real good think about why poor old Eric might have to put up with shit every now and again. Come on people, think!. It's about time you and your acolytes accepted the truth Eric, you get harassed because you're an unreconstructed c-word, a hypocrite's hypocrite who has grade-A special protection, a perfect example of the vested editor phenomenon that undermines every aspect of Wikipedia, that no amount of quality writing about your extensive knowledge of ferret bothering will ever make up for.\"\n",

This entire paragraph is just a series of claims made by ICMEC, not even a claim made by or supported by a neutral third party, so it should be worded to reflect that. We have more weasel in \"\"ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography\"\". We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis. A&C; Black. pp. 82–83, makes no mention of at all of child pornography, but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part, and which, according to the source resulted in \"\"little to solve the problems\"\".

However, some send their kid to a Hebrew speaking school - I had an Arab classmate, for instance (whose father was a department head in the city hospital, by the way). Many Arabs live in towns with a Jewish majority, and there's no law against that, and no one prevents them from doing so.

By far the main number of references on news.google for 'Macedonia country' reveals \"\"Macedonia\"\" as the common term, but we knew that is the common English usage. How Macedonia can be ambiguous in a list of nations is beyond me, apart from the fact that Macedonia happens to be a disamb. page. But being a disambig. page on WP does not imply disambiguity in the real world, or for that sake in this list. The reason the WP article is at \"\"Rep. of\"\" is only to disambiguate. Likewise Denmark can refer to loads of different stuff, so why not link to \"\"Kingdom of Denmark\"\". The difference? The ad hoc nature of wikipedia.

The much publicised \"\"Nazi\"\" leader Lincoln Rockwell was a creature of the Zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich American Jews that they should contribute to the Zionists, who would protect them from threatened \"\"anti-Semitism\"\".

The reference only provides one example: \"\"accepted to college\"\". As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on \"\"linguistic matters\"\"? It is difficult to guess them solely from one example (that an expression is newer than it actually is). If the sentence were clearer, it would easier to verify it.  \"\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as my ban expires, I shall revert the English people page to that which had been agreed by a consensus of editors, though I hope that someone else does so sooner. In the meantime, I shall attempt to address each of the issues raised by User:Lord Loxley's in his \"\"revisions\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In the \"\"related ethnic groups\"\" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further down the article you have inserted a sentence saying that the Tudors are the chief representative of the English kingdom. This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled \"\"Royalty\"\", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab\n",

It is a somewhat inflammatory word.  To many (esp. conservatives), \"\"activist\"\" is an insult.  I think \"\"activist\"\" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style \"\"activism,\"\" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. \"\"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools\"\" or something like that.

I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;\n",

It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and \"\"Marc Gévry\"\" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 \"\"votes\"\" in favour of \"\"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]\"\", and one (yourself) directly opposed.

This article is entitled \"\"List of Presidents of the United States,\"\" NOT \"\"List of President-elects of the United States\"\" or \"\"List of President and President-elects of the United States.\"\" Go ahead and read the constitution if you don't believe me. One month to go, you never know if the president elects is going to die (somewhat like William Henry Harrison (albeit after swearing in) within weeks), or the electors get some mad spasm and vote wrongly from what is assigned. (electors have not always voted exactly as they were appointed to) At any rate, the point is, the vote for the presidency has technically not occurred yet.   \n",

      "Hi Scorpion,. I'm a bit aggravated as I provided a valid source from Canada's Walk of Fame saying that Ryan Reynolds will not be inducted on October 1, 2011 like it states in your edit. The way that you put is that we should ignore the source and just merge the columns on  the night of October 1, but according to sources, Reynolds will be unable to attend and he will be inducted at a later date, and will not be featured on the televised gala. It states that he will be inducted at a later date whether it be 2011 or 2012. (We don't know the specifics) If you merge the two columns on October 1, you are providing an untruth with regards as not all announced 2011 inductees will be inducted on the same day.  WWe should keep Ryan Reynolds seperate from the other inductees until we know for sure when he will be able to get his star.\n",

      "I'm sorry to get angry at you, but I think I am within the right to add this edit on to the page because I provided a valid source from the official commitee that says that one person's involvement has been postponed, and all that you are doing is reverting my edits, trying to sweep this fact under the carpet. As you said in your previous edit, why should it matter if the two columns will be merged in a month? Well, I thought Wikipedia was based on facts and sources, which I thought I had provided and you are selectfully omitting certain details thus allowing some inconsistencies in the article itself. You are the one that will be merging the two columns, and I don't think it would be fair and truthful to just merge Ryan Reynolds along with the other 2011 inductees into the main grid, if we still do not know when he will get inducted. That's what's getting me upset at your ways at handling the page. I did nothing wrong, just provided a valid source and I truly believe that tthere should be some sort of indication on the page at least that Ryan Reynold could not attend on October 1 due toi a scheduling conflict until we know of what will happen with Ryan Reynolds and Canada's walk of Fame.

      " Umm, neither of those examples is actually correct. On metalworking machinery, they are dovetail *slides*. They don't join. They make a sliding fit which is resistant to lifting. You can achieve the same effect with box ways by putting a sliding surface along the opposite side from the main bearing surface, but a dovetail is cheaper to make. In turbines, they are not called dovetails and they are not the same shape. They are called \"\"christmas trees\"\" in the shop, my aging brain has forgotten the correct technical term. But it ain't \"\"dovetail.\"\" They are shaped like an upside-down christmas tree with NO SHARP CORNERS. The principal is similar but not the same as a dovetail. Also, in general they are once again not a tight fit. They have to have a fair amnount of clearance to account for large temperature variations. In operation they actually rattle around some. So once again, as this article is mostly about permanent or semi-permanent joints, the use in turbines and metalworking equipment does not seem applicable. 210.22.142.82  \"\n",

      "Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with \"\"approve & oppose\"\". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write \"\"weak approve\"\" or \"\"strong approve\"\" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using \"\"violence\"\". Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc.\n",

      "Just noticed your question on my talkpage — somehow I'd missed it.  My understanding of the WP convention is that if a player is rostered with a club for any significant period of time, that club is listed in his infobox even if the player makes no appearances for the club.  If a player only passes through briefly and makes no appearances for the club, however, it isn't listed.  As for the other question, I'd say it's fairly common in the US for a player to spend a very brief period on the roster of one club before being traded to another: for instance, in the 2006 expansion draft, expansion franchise Toronto FC snapped up a couple of guys simply for their \"\"trade value\"\" and then proceeded to deal them to other teams in exchange for players they actually wanted.  I believe that in circumstances like this, we wouldn't list a Toronto FC tenure in a player's infobox.  Overall, my understanding of the guidelines here is pretty shakey, to be honest.

I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a \"\"unanimous\"\" \"\"consensus\"\" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually \"\"neutral\"\".
