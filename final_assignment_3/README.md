# ML assignment 3, option 1 documentation

## Data 

**Data: Amazon Fine Food Reviews**. The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of 455,000 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012. 

Using [KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) clustering to create a **recommendation engine.** 

Objctive: Group the right features and number of clusters when the products in each cluster "seem" like they belong together. 


#### Clustering

Looking from the graph [image](https://github.com/visualizedata/ml/blob/master/final_assignment_3/option_1/kmeans_amazon.ipynb) 
I chose '21' as the optimal k-mean since the point represents the best evaluation of the data set. 

### Your work will be assessed on: 

* data processing and transformation  
* choosing the right number of clusters for the problem  
* the organization and documentation of your GitHub repository  
* communication of your work in class reflections and final presentations  
* model improvement over the semester

### Include with submission: 

* your Python code in a Jupyter Notebook (include all code that contributed to your final model, including data work and feature transformations)  
* plots that show why you chose the number of clusters you chose  
* clear documentation that demonstrates cluster results for "good" clusters (including photos, by cluster)
